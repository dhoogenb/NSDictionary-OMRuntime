NSDictionary-OMRuntime
======================

Additional methods for NS(Mutable)Dictionary to support array subscripting syntax for SDK's before iOS 6. Xcode 4.4 does support the new modern Objective-C runtime features for NSNumber, NSArray and NSDictionary. All but subscripting (like myArray[42] and myDict[@"name"]). This only is available with the iOS 6.0 SDK for Xcode 4.5.
With this category you can enable this for iOS 5.1 and earlier for Xcode 4.4.
